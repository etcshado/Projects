This is my third project for computer science project.

It is basically a version of TicTacToe called Ultimate Tic Tac Toe.

It was required to be done using GUI components (swing or javafx).

It consists of:

- the actual game
- JTable containing moves the players have picked.
- Additional JTable containing moves on a single tictactoe game, only if it has finished.
- choosing screen
- ending screen

Here's the choosing screen

I didn't complete the project, meaning i didn't implement playing with a bot.

Here's the playing screen

You can see, the places where you can put your mark are highlighted with a green color. You can also move using numpad.

On the right side you can see a list of all the moves, including the count of the move, the player, index on the main game and index on the mini-game.

If you click on one of the finished games a list will popup, where you can see individual player moves on that mini-game.

This is a simple screen showing who won.
