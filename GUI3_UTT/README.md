This is my third project for computer science project.

It is basically a version of TicTacToe called Ultimate Tic Tac Toe.

It was required to be done using GUI components (swing or javafx).

As you can see, it consists of:

- the actual game
- JTable containing moves the players have picked.
- Additional JTable containing moves on a single tictactoe game, only if it has finished.
- choosing screen
- ending screen

I didn't complete the project, meaning i didn't implement playing with a bot.

This is a simple screen showing who won.
