OVERVIEW:

Classes of which data will be visualized.
example: DzialPracownikow (department), Pracownik (worker)...

This project was about creating a GUI for the classes, which must be able to:

a) Add new data

b) Edit data

c) Delete data

d) If a class has a list of objects, the user must be able to view them in a format that is not obscure

d.2) example: Brygadzista has a list of Brygada which he is in (kind of like a department)

e) If class Zlecenie has any jobs that are not yet finished, create a way of ending them.

f) Create a login page, only authenticated users are allowed to view the Dashboard

g) User has to be able to change his password, and log out.

ALL OF THE ABOVE OPTIONS, MUST CHANGE THE OBJECT ITSELF, NOT JUST CHANGE THE DATA IN GUI!!!
