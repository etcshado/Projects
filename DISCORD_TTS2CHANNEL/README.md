Hi, this is a simple python project that takes input from your microhpone, translates it to text,

And depending on what is in speech_to_text2.py, will print out a message on a channel.

To use this, you need to create a .properties config file with these paremeters:

**TOKEN=YourDiscordBotToken**

**CHANNEL_ID=YourDesiredChannelId**

This program sends a message: "witam wszystkich", which translates to hello everyone, if you say "witam" (welcome).
